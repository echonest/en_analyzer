en_analyzer~

en_analyzer~ provides an interface to access The Echo Nest's audio analysis 
API in Max/MSP. The object uploads the audio data in an identically-named 
buffer~ object to The Echo Nest's servers for analysis, then stores and 
outputs the analysis data in Max.

Usage:
You will need an Echo Nest API key to use this object. Register for a key at 
http://developer.echonest.com/.

To use en_analyzer~, first put the object file (.mxo) somewhere where the Max 
application can find it. Usually this is done by adding the path to 
en_analyzer~.mxo in the "Options->File Preferences..." menu.

In Max, create a new en_analyzer~ object, and use the first argument to specify 
the name of the buffer~ containing the audio data you'd like to analyze. You 
can specify your API key by passing it as the second argument to the object, or 
by sending en_analyzer~ a message like "api_key WHATEVER", or by entering your 
API key manually in the object's inspector. Sending the object an "analyze" 
message makes the magic happen. First, the audio data in your buffer is saved 
to a temporary file. en_analyzer~ checks to see if this audio data has already 
been analyzed by The Echo Nest, and if so it retrieves the analysis data. If 
no existing analysis is found, the object uploads the temporary file for 
analysis. You must be connected to the internet to retrieve analysis data; 
once the data has been retrieved and stored in the object, you can continue to 
use it even if you go offline until you close your patch. Depending on the 
speed of your connection, uploading the audio data for analysis may take a 
minute.

When your audio data has been analyzed, the analysis data is downloaded and 
stored in the object, where it can be accessed by sending en_analyzer~ messages 
like "bar 2", "section 3", "segment 29", or "global". See the en_analyzer~ help 
file for more information.

Currently, en_analyzer~ only exists as a universal binary for OS X. Xcode and 
Visual Studio projects are provided as starting points. If you want to build 
the object yourself, you'll need the Max 5 SDK, as well as the following 
external libraries:

- libcurl – http://curl.haxx.se/
	Open source C library to access online data.
- json-c - http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/
	Open source C library to parse JSON.
- libsndfile - http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
	Open source C library to read and write audiofiles.
